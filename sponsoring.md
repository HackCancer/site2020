# LET'S DO IT

## Support us

Our non-profit organisation relies on sponsors like you who see the value of supporting this kind of charitable and innovative event. Your collaboration will allow us to provide a fantastic venue, judges, talks, food, beverages, prizes and support after the hackathon for the Hack Cancer attendees. Moreover, the cash sponsors will help us reach our goal of raising over 5.000€ for the Aspanogi Society.


# NEED TO KNOW

This year HackCancer will go together with EuroScipy 2020 and GeoPython, being
EuroPython as head of the organization. In this page we are giving small packages for
HAckCancer 2020 Datathon Caretakers, but we are able to give combined tiers with
EuroScipy and HackCancer conferences. Both Conference will bring more than 300 scientists
together in the same venue with more than 50 talks and 4 parallel tracks with HackCancer
Datathon happening together.

EuroScipy 2020 sponsoring information is available [here](https://www.euroscipy.org/2020/sponsoring.html)
